Created a Python-based web scraping workflow to build a structured lyrics dataset for profanity analysis experiments.

Key points:
- Used BeautifulSoup and lxml for robust scraping and parsing.
- Built a clean data extraction and normalization flow.
- Produced a reusable dataset for downstream NLP analysis.
